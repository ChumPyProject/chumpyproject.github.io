<p>ChumPy will have some different priorities in comparison to other software projects. As the original Chummer is still working we don't have any time pressure and want our implementation of Chummer to fix the "issues" with the original Chummer. We want it to be truly cross-platform compatible. It will be runnable on Windows, Linux and OS X, but that's not where it's going to end. ChumPy will run on Android, iOS and WindowsPhone - tablets as well as smartphones.</p>

<h3>
<a id="additional-features" class="anchor" href="#additional-features" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Additional Features</h3>

<p>We're going to basically clone Chummer, but we'll add some handy improvements - as you can easily bring ChumPy to the table. We're aiming for simple things like Dice Rollers, Ammo Tracking, Condition Monitors or an Initiative Tracker. Furthermore things like Sprite, Spirit, Drone or Cyberdeck Assistance will be included. We'll introduce a platform to create and share NPCs and Runs, we'll add a special mode for the GameMaster - where he can easily managed his runs, track the groups progress and even manage different groups.</p>

<h3>
<a id="arrangement-with-chummer" class="anchor" href="#arrangement-with-chummer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Arrangement with Chummer</h3>

<p>Every single feature from the original Chummer will be implemented. You will be able to create your characters like you are with Chummer right now. We're not going to change the workflow you've established over the years, we're only going to make it available to everyone, everywhere.</p>
